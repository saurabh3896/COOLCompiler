The code for various phases in a **COOL** (Classroom-object-oriented-language) program compilation, namely, **lexing** (checking for
syntax errors as well as capturing names for objects to be passed for the next phase), **parsing** (building the Abstract-Syntax-Tree),
, **semantic-analysis** (checking for code sanity) and the **codegen** phase (generating the LLVM-IR code for the input program).
The complete code is written in JAVA using **ANTLR** APIs.
